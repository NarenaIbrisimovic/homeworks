      <h2>Through World War II</h2>
   	    <p>The club was formed in 1900 when a number of football enthusiasts split from Münchner TurnVerein 1879 to escape the influence of the club's gymnasts, who did not hold a great enthusiasm for the new game – an attitude typical of the times. Almost from the start, Bayern was a strong local side, but failed to have much of an impact beyond that.

For financial reasons, and to take advantage of better facilities held by other clubs, they twice entered into mergers. In 1906, they negotiated a union with Münchner Sport Club. As part of the arrangement, the footballers gave up black as one of their team colours and adopted the red of their new partners, which they wear to this day. Bayern won their first title, as champions of the Bavarian league, in 1909 as a department of MSC. In 1919, shortly after World War I, Bayern left MSC, whose focus turned to field hockey and tennis, sports they are still active in today. Bayern then joined forces with Turn- und Sportverein 1890 Jahn München until leaving that club in 1923, and have remained independent ever since.

In those early days, Bavarian football was dominated by teams from Franconia, in the north of the state, notably 1. FC Nürnberg and their twin town neighbours SpVgg Fürth. In 1914, Fürth became the first team from the state to become national champions and by 1930 these two sides had accumulated eight titles between them. Bayern President Kurt Landauer held the office on and off from 1913 until 1933 and from 1947 well into the 1950s, adopted a strategic approach to building up the team and challenging this dominance. He hired William Townley as the side's first professional coach. The Englishman was the best coach on the market in Germany and had a championship with Karlsruher FV, in 1910, to his credit.

In 1926, Bayern won the South German Championship, but found themselves outdone by local rivals 1860 Munich who, in 1931, became the first side from the Bavarian capital to reach the national final. Inside a year, Bayern topped that by even winning the Championship in the final against Eintracht Frankfurt. The team coached by the Hungarian Richard Dombi triumphed through a penalty by Oskar "Ossi" Rohr and another goal by Franz Krumm, 2–0.

But history was against Bayern. The advent of the Hitler regime saw the Jewish President Landauer resigning quickly, and the team visiting him in his Swiss exile did not help their fortunes in the new era. Dombi, also a Jew, moved to the Netherlands, where he picked up the reins of SC Feijenoord in Rotterdam, and laid the foundations for the future greatness of the club. In the ensuing years the club decayed into irrelevance.

The last recorded football match played in the Reich was the derby between Bayern and 1860 Munich (3–2) on 23 April 1945. Less than three weeks later, Germany capitulated.</p>

<h2>Early successes in the Bundesliga</h2>
<p>With the beginning of the 1963–64 season the first German division – which until then had been split into five regional divisions – was unified into one national league, the Bundesliga.

The start of the new league saw disappointment for Bayern. As TSV 1860 had just won the last Oberliga championship – one of the few occasions they have been ahead of Bayern in that era – it was they who joined the new elite of German football. Bayern's newly elected president Wilhelm Neudecker, the father of the modern FC Bayern, hired Zlatko "Czik" Čajkovski, a former Yugoslav World Cup player in 1950 and 1954, who had also achieved fame for coaching Cologne to the 1962 championship. This coup paid off, as he formed an aspiring team with the talented young players that should later be referred to as "the axis": goal keeper Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller. After missing out on promotion to the Bundesliga in 1964, finishing second in the league behind Hessen Kassel, Bayern won the Regionalliga Süd (II) in 1965 and gained promotion alongside future rival Borussia Mönchengladbach.

The team, average age 22, immediately reached third place in the league in a year when a sparkling 1860 won their first and only national champions title. Even more important for Bayern was the win in the Cup final against MSV Duisburg (4–2), leading them into the Cup Winners Cup.

The team's star was 20-year-old Franz Beckenbauer, who finished the season by playing at the World Cup 1966 in England where he captured the imagination of a global audience. His efforts were rewarded with a third place in the voting for Europe's Player of the Year.

In the next season, Bayern became the third German team ever to defend the German Cup as Hamburg proved easy prey in the final and were defeated with a record 4–0 win. The highlight was the participation in the European Cup Winners Cup in Nuremberg which the team won in a final 1–0 against Rangers. The goal in extra time was scored by Franz "the Bull" Roth, who would win many other cup finals for Bayern.

A slowdown of progress in the 1967–68 season saw another Yugoslav, Branko Zebec, taking over Čajkovski's job. He curbed the offensive style of the Bayern play and the discipline paid off when Bayern won the 1968–69 Championship with the Cup to boot: the first double in Bundesliga history. During the whole season Bayern used only 13 players.

Borussia Mönchengladbach, promoted to the Bundesliga in the same year as Bayern, emerged as serious rivals to Bayern's ascendancy. They won the next two championships, and Bayern president Neudecker, on the recommendation of Beckenbauer, called on Udo Lattek from the coaching staff of the national team to take over the reins at Bayern. In his first year, he only managed to return the Cup to the banks of Isar river, but with young and hungry reinforcements such as Paul Breitner and Uli Hoeneß he formed the team that achieved the first German Championship hat-trick in history.</p>
